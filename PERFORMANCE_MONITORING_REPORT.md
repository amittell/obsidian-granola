- **Performance:** Modal loading ~60ms, Interactions ~0.1ms, Processing ~5ms

## Monitoring Systems Implementation

### 1. Bundle Size Tracking (`scripts/bundle-size-tracker.js`)

**Features:**

- Tracks bundle size changes over time with git integration
- Configurable regression thresholds (5% or 1024 bytes)
- Historical data storage with 100-entry limit
- CI integration with exit codes for regressions

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run monitor:bundle track    # Record current size
npm run monitor:bundle check    # Check for regressions
npm run monitor:bundle report   # Show detailed report
npm run monitor:bundle history  # Show size history
```

**Size Breakdown by Component:**

- Document Selection Modal: 18,153 bytes (24.4%)
- Conflict Resolution Modal: 11,599 bytes (15.6%)
- Import Manager: 7,907 bytes (10.6%)
- Converter: 9,867 bytes (13.3%)
- Settings: 7,945 bytes (10.7%)
