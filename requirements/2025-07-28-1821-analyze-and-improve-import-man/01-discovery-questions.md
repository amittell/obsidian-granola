**Total Questions:** 5

## Q1: Are users experiencing performance issues with the current import process for large document sets?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (performance optimization suggests current issues with scale)

## Q2: Do users need to import documents in parallel batches for better throughput?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (modern async patterns typically improve perceived performance)

## Q3: Should the improved import manager maintain backward compatibility with existing import workflows?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (breaking changes should be avoided in established codebases)

## Q4: Will users need real-time visual feedback during long-running import operations?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (the current implementation already provides progress tracking)

## Q5: Do users expect memory-efficient processing for very large document collections?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (memory constraints are common with large datasets)
