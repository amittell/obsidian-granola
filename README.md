# Granola Importer Plugin for Obsidian

A lean, beautiful Obsidian plugin that imports your Granola notes with perfect formatting preservation.

## What is Granola?

[Granola](https://www.granola.ai) is the AI notepad for people in back-to-back meetings. It takes your raw meeting notes and transcribes your meetings, then uses AI to enhance your notes when the meeting ends. Granola works on all platforms with no meeting bots, making it perfect for capturing and organizing your meeting insights.

## Features

- **One-click import** of all your Granola notes
- **Perfect formatting preservation** from ProseMirror to Markdown
