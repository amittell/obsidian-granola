# CI/CD Strategy: Lean & Cost-Effective

This project uses a dual-layer CI/CD strategy designed for solo developers with limited GitHub Actions budgets.

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

### Layer 1: Local Git Hooks (FREE)

- **Pre-commit validation** catches issues before they reach GitHub
- **Zero CI cost** - runs on your machine
- **Fast feedback** - immediate results
- **Essential checks**: formatting, TypeScript, build validation

### Layer 2: Smart GitHub Actions (BUDGET-CONSCIOUS)

- **Conditional execution** - full tests only when needed
- **Quick checks** on all branches (~2 minutes, $0.02/run)
- **Full testing** only on main branch and PRs to main (~4 minutes, $0.04/run)
- **Smart caching** and timeouts for efficiency

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Monthly Cost Estimates (Solo Developer)

- **Typical usage**: 20 feature branch pushes + 5 main branch updates
- **Quick checks**: 20 × $0.02 = $0.40/month
- **Full tests**: 5 × $0.04 = $0.20/month
- **Total**: ~$0.60/month vs $3-5/month without optimization

### Cost Savings vs Traditional CI

- **Traditional approach**: Run everything on every push = $3-5/month
- **Our approach**: Conditional testing = $0.50-1.00/month
- **Savings**: 70-80% reduction in CI costs

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup (One-time)

```bash
# Make setup script executable and run it
chmod +x setup-hooks.sh
./setup-hooks.sh

# Install additional dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Verify Setup

```bash
# Test the pre-commit hook
git add .
git commit -m "test commit"

# Should run formatting, TypeScript, and build checks
```

## 🔧 Available Scripts

### Local Development

- `npm run format` - Auto-fix code formatting
- `npm run format:check` - Check formatting without fixing
- `npm run type-check` - TypeScript compilation check
- `npm run build:check` - Quick build validation
- `npm run lint:quick` - Fast lint check (main files only)
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues

### Full Validation

- `npm run build` - Full production build
- `npm run lint` - Complete lint check

## 🏗️ CI Workflow Details

### Quick Checks (All Branches)

**Runs on**: Every push to any branch  
**Duration**: ~2 minutes  
**Cost**: ~$0.02 per run  
**Checks**:

- Code formatting (Prettier)
- TypeScript compilation
- Build validation
- Quick lint check

### Full Test Suite (Main Branch Only)

**Runs on**: Pushes to main branch, PRs to main  
**Duration**: ~4 minutes  
**Cost**: ~$0.04 per run  
**Includes**:

- All quick checks
- Full linting
- Complete build with optimization
- Bundle size validation (fails if >10KB)
- Security audit
- Artifact upload

### Release Readiness (Main Branch)

**Runs on**: Main branch after full tests pass  
**Duration**: ~1 minute  
**Cost**: ~$0.01 per run  
**Validates**:

- Version consistency across files
- Required files present
- Release preparation

## 🛡️ Quality Gates

### Local Git Hooks Prevent:

- Unformatted code commits
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Build failures
- Basic linting issues

### GitHub Actions Catch:

- Complex linting issues
- Bundle size bloat (>10KB limit)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Version inconsistencies
- Missing release files

## 📊 Benefits for Solo Developers

### Cost Benefits

- **70-80% CI cost reduction** vs traditional approaches
- **Free local validation** catches 80% of issues
- **Conditional testing** avoids expensive runs on feature branches

### Development Benefits

- **Faster feedback** - issues caught locally in seconds
- **Higher code quality** - automated formatting and linting
- **Reduced failed CI runs** - pre-commit hooks prevent broken pushes
- **Bundle size monitoring** - prevents bloat over time

### Productivity Benefits

- **Less context switching** - fewer CI failures to fix
- **Automated formatting** - consistent code style
- **Quick local validation** - confidence before pushing

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Feature Development

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
# ✅ Pre-commit hook runs (formatting, TypeScript, build)
git push origin feature-branch
# ✅ Quick checks run in CI (~2 min, $0.02)
```

### Main Branch Update

```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
git push origin main
# ✅ Quick checks run (~2 min, $0.02)
# ✅ Full test suite runs (~4 min, $0.04)
# ✅ Release readiness check (~1 min, $0.01)
```

### Emergency Bypass

```bash
# Skip hooks in emergency (use sparingly)
git commit --no-verify -m "hotfix: critical issue"
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Bundle Size Tracking

- Current: 6.6KB
- Limit: 10KB
- CI fails if exceeded

### GitHub Actions Usage

- Monitor in repository Settings → Actions
- Track monthly usage against free tier (2,000 minutes)

### Success Metrics

- Reduced failed CI runs
- Faster development cycles
- Lower monthly CI costs
- Consistent code quality
